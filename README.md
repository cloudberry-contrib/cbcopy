# cbcopy

cbcopy is an efficient database migration tool designed to transfer data and metadata from Greenplum Database(GPDB) to Apache Cloudberry(Cloudberrydb), while also supporting migrations between Greenplum databases and between Cloudberry databases for disaster recovery and database version upgrades.

## How does cbcopy work?

### Metadata migration
The metadata migration feature of cbcopy is based on [gpbackup](https://github.com/greenplum-db/gpbackup-archive). Compared to GPDB's built-in `pg_dump`, cbcopy's main advantage is its ability to retrieve metadata in batches. While `pg_dump` fetches metadata one row or a few rows at a time, cbcopy retrieves it in batches. This batch processing approach significantly enhances performance, especially when handling large volumes of metadata, making it much faster than `pg_dump`.

### Data migration
Both GPDB and CBDB support starting programs via SQL commands, and cbcopy utilizes this feature. During data migration, it uses SQL commands to start a program on the target database to receive and load data, while simultaneously using SQL commands to start a program on the source database to unload data and send it to the program on the target database.

## Pre-Requisites

The project requires the Go Programming language version 1.19 or higher. Follow the directions [here](https://golang.org/doc/) for installation, usage and configuration instructions.

## Downloading

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/HashDataInc/cbcopy.git
```

## Building and installing binaries
Switch your current working directory to the above `cbcopy` source directory

**Build**

```bash
make
```
This will build the cbcopy and cbcopy_helper binaries in the source directory.

**Install**

```bash
make install
```
This will install the cbcopy and cbcopy_helper programs binaries the `$GPHOME/bin` directory. Note that GPDB must be sourced for this to work.

## Test
### Test setup
Some integration tests depend on the `dummy_seclabel` extension in the Database. Therefore, you need to install the `dummy_seclabel` extension in the Database first. This extension exists only to support testing of the SECURITY LABEL statement and is not intended for use in production. After successfully installing the `dummy_seclabel` extension, use the following commands to enable it.

```bash
# Configure the shared_preload_libraries parameter to include the dummy_seclabel extension
gpconfig -c shared_preload_libraries -v dummy_seclabel

# Restart the Greenplum database to apply the changes
gpstop -ra

# Verify that the dummy_seclabel extension has been successfully added to shared_preload_libraries
gpconfig -s shared_preload_libraries | grep dummy_seclabel
```

### Running tests
To run all tests except end-to-end (unit, and integration), use:
```bash
make test
```

To run only unit tests, use:
```bash
make unit
```

Running integration tests requires a database instance with the gpcloud extension installed, and the database must be configured with the `--with-perl` option:
```bash
make integration
```

To run end to end tests (requires a running GPDB instance), use:
```bash
make end_to_end
```

## Code Style

We use `goimports` to maintain consistent code formatting. Before submitting any changes, please run:
```bash
make format
```

This will:
- Format all Go files according to Go standard formatting rules
- Organize imports into groups (standard library, external packages, internal packages)
- Remove any unused imports
- Ensure consistent code style across the project

## Migrating Data with cbcopy

Before migrating data, you need to copy cbcopy_helper to the `$GPHOME/bin` directory on all nodes of both the source and target databases. Then you need to find a host that can connect to both the source database and the target database, and use the cbcopy command on that host to initiate the migration. Note that database superuser privileges are required for both source and target databases to perform the migration.

By default, both metadata and data are migrated. You can use `--metadata-only` to migrate only metadata, or `--data-only` to migrate only data. Based on our best practices, we recommend migrating metadata first using `--metadata-only`, and then migrating data using `--data-only`. This two-step approach helps ensure a more controlled and reliable migration process.

### Database version requirements
cbcopy relies on the "COPY ON SEGMENT" command of the database, so it has specific version requirements for the database.

- `GPDB 4.x` - A minimum of GPDB version 4.3.17 or higher is required. If your version does not meet this requirement, you can upgrade to GPDB 4.3.17.
- `GPDB 5.x` - A minimum of GPDB version 5.1.0 or higher is required. If your version does not meet this requirement, you can upgrade to GPDB 5.1.0.
- `GPDB 6.x` - cbcopy is compatible with all versions of GPDB 6.x.
- `GPDB 7.x` - cbcopy is compatible with all versions of GPDB 7.x.
- `CBDB 1.x` - cbcopy is compatible with all versions of CBDB 1.x.

### Migration Modes

cbcopy supports seven migration modes.

- `--full` - Migrate all metadata and data from the source database to the target database.
- `--dbname` - Migrate a specific database or multiple databases from the source to the target database.
- `--schema` - Migrate a specific schema or multiple schemas from the source database to the target database.
-  `--schema-mapping-file` - Migrate specific schemas specified in a file from the source database to the target database.
- `--include-table` - Migrate specific tables or multiple tables from the source database to the target database.
- `--include-table-file` - Migrate specific tables specified in a file from the source database to the target database.
- `--global-metadata-only` - Migrate global objects from the source database to the target database.

### Data Loading Modes
cbcopy supports two data loading modes.

- `--append` - Insert the migrated records into the table directly, regardless of the existing records.
- `--truncate` - First, clear the existing records in the table, and then insert the migrated records into the table.

### Object dependencies

If the tables you are migrating depend on certain global objects (such as tablespaces), there are two ways to handle this:

1. Include the `--with-global-metadata` option (default: false) during migration, which will automatically create these global objects in the target database.

2. If you choose not to use `--with-global-metadata`, you must manually create these global objects in the target database before running the migration. For example:
   ```sql
   -- If your tables use custom tablespaces, create them first:
   CREATE TABLESPACE custom_tablespace LOCATION '/path/to/tablespace';
   ```

If neither option is taken, the creation of dependent tables in the target database will fail with errors like "tablespace 'custom_tablespace' does not exist".

### Role
If you want to change the ownership of the tables during migration without creating identical roles in the target database (by disabling the `--with-global-metadata` option), you need to:

1. First create the target roles in the target database
2. Use the `--owner-mapping-file` to specify the mapping between source and target roles

For example, if you have a mapping file with:
```
source_role1,target_role1
source_role2,target_role2
```

The migration process will execute statements like:
```sql
ALTER TABLE table_name OWNER TO target_role1;
```

If the target role doesn't exist in the target database, these ownership change statements will fail with an error like "role 'target_role1' does not exist".

### Tablespace
cbcopy provides three ways to handle tablespace migration:

1. **Default Mode** - When no tablespace options are specified, objects will be created in the same tablespace names as they were in the source database. You have two options to ensure the tablespaces exist in the target database:
   - Use `--with-global-metadata` to automatically create matching tablespaces
   - Manually create the tablespaces in the target database before migration:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLESPACE custom_space LOCATION '/path/to/tablespace';
     ```

2. **Single Target Tablespace** (`--dest-tablespace`) - Migrate all source database objects into a single specified tablespace on the target database, regardless of their original tablespace locations. For example:
   ```bash
   cbcopy --dest-tablespace=new_space ...
   ```

3. **Tablespace Mapping** (`--tablespace-mapping-file`) - Map source tablespaces to different target tablespaces using a mapping file. This is useful when you want to maintain separate tablespaces or map them to different locations. The mapping file format is:
   ```
   source_tablespace1,target_tablespace1
   source_tablespace2,target_tablespace2
   ```

Note: 
- For the default mode, either use `--with-global-metadata` or ensure all required tablespaces exist in the target database before migration
- If you need to migrate objects from different schemas into different tablespaces, you can either:
  1. Use `--tablespace-mapping-file` to specify all mappings at once
  2. Migrate one schema at a time using `--dest-tablespace` with different target tablespaces

### Parallel Jobs

- `--copy-jobs` - The maximum number of tables that concurrently copies.

### Validate Migration
During migration, we will compare the number of rows returned by `COPY TO` from the source database (i.e., the number of records coming out of the source database) with the number of rows returned by `COPY FROM` in the target database (i.e., the number of records loaded in the target database). If the two counts do not match, the migration of that table will fail.

### Copy Strategies

cbcopy internally supports three copy strategies for tables.

- `Copy On Coordinator` - If the table's statistics `pg_class->reltuples` is less than `--on-segment-threshold`, cbcopy will enable the `Copy On Coordinator` strategy for this table, meaning that data migration between the source and target databases can only occur through the coordinator node.
- `Copy On Segment` - If the table's statistics `pg_class->reltuples` is greater than `--on-segment-threshold`, and both the source and target databases have the same version and the same number of nodes, cbcopy will enable the `Copy On Segment` strategy for this table. This means that data migration between the source and target databases will occur in parallel across all segment nodes without data redistribution.
- `Copy on External Table` - For tables that do not meet the conditions for the above two strategies, cbcopy will enable the `Copy On External Table` strategy. This means that data migration between the source and target databases will occur in parallel across all segment nodes with data redistribution.

### Log Files and Migration Results

After cbcopy completes its execution, it generates several files in the `$USER/gpAdminLogs` directory:

1. **Log File**
   - `cbcopy_$timestamp.log` - Contains all execution logs, including:
     - Debug messages
     - Error messages
     - Operation details

2. **Migration Result Files**
   - `cbcopy_succeed_$timestamp` - Lists all successfully migrated tables
   - `cbcopy_failed_$timestamp` - Lists all tables that failed to migrate

These files are useful for:
- Monitoring the migration process
- Troubleshooting any issues
- Planning retry attempts for failed migrations

### Handling Failed Migrations

When a migration fails partially (some tables succeed while others fail), cbcopy generates two files:
- `cbcopy_succeed_$timestamp` - Lists all successfully migrated tables
- `cbcopy_failed_$timestamp` - Lists all tables that failed to migrate

For retry attempts, you can skip previously successful tables by using the success file:
```bash
cbcopy --exclude-table-file=cbcopy_succeed_$timestamp ...
```

This approach helps you:
- Save time by not re-migrating successful tables
- Reduce the risk of data inconsistency
- Focus only on resolving failed migrations

## Examples

### Basic Migration
```bash
# Migrate specific schemas
cbcopy --with-global-metadata --source-host=127.0.0.1 \
    --source-port=45432 --source-user=gpadmin \
    --dest-host=127.0.0.1 --dest-port=55432 \
    --dest-user=cbdb --schema=source_db.source_schema \
    --dest-schema=target_db.target_schema \
    --truncate
```
